# Java React S3 Image Uploader

Image Uploader built using Spring Boot, React and AWS S3.
*(React code not included)*

This project was built to practice building a REST API in Spring Boot and connecting it to a front end. <br/>
I used an in-memory database with 2 users. <br/>
The web application allows users to drag and drop a photo which is sent to the backend which then updates the AWS S3 bucket. <br/>
Upon refreshing, the new profile picture is displayed on the web application. <br/><br/><br/>
